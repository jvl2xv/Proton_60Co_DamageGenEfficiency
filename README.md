# Proton_60Co_DamageGenEfficiency
Contains data and code associated with the paper: Damage Generation Eï¬ƒciency of Protons and 60Co Gammas in III-V Infrared Semiconductors

Contents:
Proton_60Co_Compare.py: Contains the code to read in the GEANT4 simulation results and SR-NIEL results to calculate the NIEL per incident photon or incident proton. Contains the code to read in the TRPL results as a function of proton or photon exposure, fit, and derive damage factors. Code also generates plots for the paper pertaining to this information. 

Simulaton_Results - Contains all GEANT4-generated files
Experimental_Results - Contains all experimental TRPL decays
